kazam (0.12~ppa1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Temporarily disabled ffmpeg support and removed all dependencies for
    ffmpeg.
  * Default backend is now gstreamer and will hopefully stay this way.
  * Video is now encoded with vp8 instead of x264 due to availability
    problems.
  * Audio is now encoded with Ogg Vorbis.
  * A/V container is now WebM.
  * Support for multiple displays is somewhat broken. It will probably
    workif you have two displays side by side.
  * Audio device selection is now done directly from PulseAudio. To record
    application sounds instead of microphone input you will have to select
    one of the monitor devices.
