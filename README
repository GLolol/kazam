           Kazam Screencaster v0.91


Introduction
------------

Kazam is a simple screen recording program that will capture the content
of your screen and record a video file that can be played by any video
player that supports VP8/WebM video format.

Optionally you can record sound from any sound input device that is
supported and visible by PulseAudio.


Latest version
--------------

Kazam is always available from Launchpad under https://launchpad.net/kazam

Right now there are only unstable versions available, the project is still
in development and a stable release is planned for Ubuntu 12.04.


Installation
------------

For Ubuntu, the best way to install is to add a PPA repository and then
use apt-get command or Software Center.

For distribution independent installation you will have to get the latest
source code from Launchpad by running the following command:

   $ bzr branch lp:kazam

Then you need to run setup.py to build and install Kazam:

   $ cd kazam
   # python setup.py install

You will have to run setup as root user or use sudo. Default installation
path is /usr/local.



Known Issues
------------

- Ffmpeg support and video editing with Kazam are currently not working and
are disabled, for now.

- Support for multiple monitors is there, but your mileage may vary. It
was tested only on two screen setup where both screens are side by side. With
Region recording the Video source is ignored.

- Placing Region selector outside of screen borders will produce unknown
results and you will probably end up with no recording.

- Two warnings appear during the normal usage:

/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gobject/constants.py:24: Warning:
g_boxed_type_register_static: assertion `g_type_from_name (name) == 0' failed

This happens when Gtk.GObject was imported before importing gst in python
and is still being investigated. So far it appears to be mostly harmless.

Second warning comes from Gtk.FileChooser():

kazam:5144): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to retrieve the file info for <file>
Error stating file <file> : No such file or directory

This happens when you confirm file save in the dialog box. This is an error
in Gtk.FileChooser and in Precise Pangolin it is already fixed.
