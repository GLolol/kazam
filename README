           Kazam Screencaster v0.12 


Introduction
------------

Kazam is a simple screen recording program that will capture the content
of your screen and record a video file that can be played by any video
player that supports VP8/WebM video format.

Optionally you can record sound from any sound input device that is
supported and visible by PulseAudio.



Latest version
--------------

Kazam is always available from Launchpad under https://launchpad.net/kazam

Right now there are only unstable versions available, the project is still
in development and a stable release is planned for Ubuntu 12.04.



Installation
------------

For Ubuntu, the best way to install is to add a PPA repository and then
use apt-get command or Software Center.

For distribution independent installation you will have to get the latest
source code from Launchpad by running the following command:

   $ bzr branch lp:kazam

Then you need to run setup.py to build and install Kazam:

   $ cd kazam
   # python setup.py install

You will have to run setup as root user or use sudo. Default installation
path is /usr/local.



Known Issues
------------

- Ffmpeg support is currently not working and has been turned off. Editing
videos with Kazam will most likely be broken.

- Support for multiple monitors is there, but your mileage may vary. It
was tested only on two screen setup where both screens are side by side.
