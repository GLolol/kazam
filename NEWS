Kazam 1.3.1 - NCC-2893 (Stargazer Edition)
------------------------------------------

- GStreamer 1.0 support, Kazam will no longer work with older versions
  of GStreamer. This includes 0.11 (1.0 alpha/beta/rc) version. Some
  encoders were changed in transition from beta to final release which
  messed up a lot of things.

- Completely new GUI. Designed by https://launchpad.net/~kokoto-java with
  the omnipresent guiding hand of https://launchpad.net/~mpt

- Support for taking still screen captures, also known as screenshots.

- Support for automatic file saving. You can set the prefix filename
  separately for screenshots and screencasts.

- Support for selecting a single window to screencast. Screenshots are
  still limited to full screen and/or area selection.

- Theme-able shutter sounds. Right now you can choose between Canon 7D
  and Nikon D80. ;)
